# RQ1 – Spatial Patterns Around Plaques

## Question
Is energy metabolism specifically disrupted near amyloid plaques?

## Computing Distance-to-Plaque
- Plaque segmentations reconstructed from dataset (or approximated if missing)
- Euclidean distance from each cell centroid to nearest plaque
- Binning: 0–50, 50–100, 100–200, 200–500, >500 µm

(Insert a figure showing plaque locations and cells)

## EnergyScore as a Function of Distance
Main figures to include:
- Line plot: EnergyScore vs distance bin by genotype
- Boxplots or violin plots per bin
- Spatial map highlighting low/high energy zones

## Results
- Strong drop in metabolic activity within the first 50 µm  
- Partial recovery beyond 200 µm  
- AD mice show systematically lower energy levels than WT  
- Effect is robust across mice  

## Interpretation
Clear, rigorous paragraph on localized metabolic stress adjacent to plaques.
